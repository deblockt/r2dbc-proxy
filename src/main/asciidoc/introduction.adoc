R2DBC Proxy is a proxy framework providing callbacks for query executions,
method invocations, and parameter bindings.

The proxy holds proxy listeners.
When a caller(application or upper layer library) interacts with the proxy, the registered
proxy listeners receive callbacks.

Followings are the sample usages of the proxy listeners:

- Logging on each query execution
- Detect slow queries
- Method tracing
- Metrics
- Distributed tracing
- Assertion and verification
- Own action

The proxy is a thin transparent layer which suits to implement cross-cutting concerns, agnostic to
the underlying implementation such as drivers; yet, it is viewed as R2DBC SPI from the above layer.
